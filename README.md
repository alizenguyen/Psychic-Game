# Psychic-Game

### Overview

Homework assignment touches on the application of JavaScript. This is first homework to dive into to JavaScript.

In this assignment, we were asked to create an app that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML powered by our JavaScript file.

### Summary

The game will begin with the app randomly picking a letter. The user has to guess which letter the app chooses. You will have 10 chances. The app will record your wrong guesses, number of wins, number of losses, and number of guesses left. 

You can set the mood and put some eerie background music!
